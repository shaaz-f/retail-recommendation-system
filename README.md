# retail-recommendation-system

This project implements a product recommendation system using PyTorch. The goal is to train a model that can recommend relevant products to users based on their past behavior, including clicks, cart additions, and purchases.

We are using Neural Collaborative Filtering in order to learn nonlinear relationships while also understanding the ins and outs of pyTorch.

## Features
Literally just preprocessing, building, training, and using the model for predictions. Also evaluation metrics.
